## 🧭 Why I Write

I believe the best way to **learn deeply** is to **teach openly**.  
This blog is my way of documenting what I learn — from configuring firewalls to analyzing zero-day attacks — so others can grow faster and avoid the same pitfalls.

> “In cybersecurity, knowledge shared is risk reduced.”
